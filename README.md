# inky-table
A library to programatically create columns and rows for inky phat

# Getting started
## Requirements
Dependancies can be installed using
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
As this project is meant to be used as a module, it should be imported into another project. I am going to be adding some examples, come back soon! For now, the unit tests should give a high level example of how to use this library.

## Testing
Pytest is the primary testing framework. Running the following command in the root directory will run all unit tests
```
pytest
```

Coverage can be included by running 
```
pytest --cov=src
```
